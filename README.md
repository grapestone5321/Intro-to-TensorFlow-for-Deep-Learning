# Keras - Python Deep Learning Neural Network API
https://deeplizard.com/learn/video/RznKVRTFkBY

Hey, we’re Chris and Mandy! We're the creators of deeplizard

## Why Keras?
Keras was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Because of this, it's very user friendly and allows us to go from idea to implementation with only a few steps.

Aside from this, users often wonder why choose Keras over another neural network API?Why Keras?

## TensorFlow Integration
Keras was originally created by François Chollet. 

Historically, Keras was a high-level API that sat on top of one of three lower level neural network APIs and acted as a wrapper to to these lower level libraries. 

These libraries were referred to as Keras backend engines.

This series will teach you how to use Keras, a neural network API written in Python. 

Each video focuses on a specific concept and shows how the full implementation is done in code using Keras and Python. 

We will learn how to preprocess data, organize data for training, build and train an artificial neural network from scratch, build and fine-tune convolutional neural networks (CNNs), implement fine-tuning and transfer learning, deploy our models using both front-end and back-end deployment techniques, and much more!
